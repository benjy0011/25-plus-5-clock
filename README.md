# 25 + 5 Clock

This is a 25 + 5 clock project developed for freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Certification.
It can be used to time for work time and break time alternately. 

ps: the styling of this project is less appealing compared to other projects because I am focusing on learning and using redux in this project. This project passed the fcc test w/o any adjustments needed.
